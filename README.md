# Salsa

Salsa is a payments app developed with Solana. Please check out [the live demo](https://solana-salsa.web.app/).  

This project was created for the [Solana Riptide Hackathon](https://solana.com/riptide).  

Salsa was being developed as a Progressive Web App with Angular 13.

## Front end
[Angular](https://angular.io/) is used for the user interface
[Angular Material](https://material.angular.io/) is used for the design scheme.

## Back end
[Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) is the primary backend service and is used for Facebook, Twitter, and email authentication.
[Cloud Firestore](https://firebase.google.com/products/firestore) was used for storage of public Solana keys and messaging.

## Payments
[Solana Pay](https://docs.solanapay.com/) was used for QR code generation and scanning.

## Thanks
Our app heavily leveraged [this project](https://github.com/RaphaelJenni/FirebaseUI-Angular) for our main login page.
